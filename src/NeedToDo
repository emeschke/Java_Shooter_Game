Asteroid miner...Mine gold and silver from the asteroid belt--kill asteroids to gain points and level up.

Asteroid, precious metals and ships go from right to left (or the same direction.)  Cursor (shooter) is a laser?  and can
move back and forth across the bottom of the screen.  Occasionally something falls straight down and can kill the shooter.

There is a maximum number of asteroids, gold, silver, and ships that are floating around.

Are there good things that fall down to capture also?  In addition to asteroids to avoid.

Shooter can move back and forth but can't move up or down.  It is always oriented toward the top.

Add music that is cool everytime we shoot a music button or pass a level.

Need to get:
--Get cursor/falcon moving sideways
--Create classes for gold, silver, ship that is sideways and asteroids of small, fixed size.XXXXXXXX
--Restrict the above classes to only go sideways in a set range (above cursor/falcon)XXXXXXXX
--Add dollar value for money.XXXXXXXX
--Add points for asteroids.XXXXXXXX
--Rule to advance levels.
--Speed of horizontal objects speeds up with level; more things fall with new level?
--Create a certain amount of gold to silver randomly in a ratio.
--Create class that falls down (bad)
--Create class that falls down (good)
--Restrict count of different items to a set amountXXXXXXXXXXXX
