Thanks for playing the game.  It is self-explanatory--the code base is modified and a nice soundtrack has been added.

Controller:
The game class is very much changed to reflect the differences between the original game engine and my game.  The changes
are documented within the the class.

Tuple is unchanged.

View:
Classes are unchanged.

Model:
Asteroid -- Restricted so that the clear asteroids only move up and down.  Some changes in the way they spawn, an
asteroid that is destroyed will spawn 0,1,2 new ones.  Also within the move method the deltaX that controls the movement
is set between 1-11 rather than 0-10 (as a random number) because otherwise sometimes the asteroids were getting
stuck not moving at the bottom of the screen where the ship goes.  Asteroids contribute 10 points to the score when they
are destroyed.

Bullet, CommandCenter, Debris, Movable, Sprite not changed.

Diamond, Gold -- New classes.  Originally these were intended to be created around a mining concept but then it turned
into a normal shooter game.  These two create different shapes that are restricted to the the top 2/3rds of the screen.
They contribute 5 points when they are destroyed.

Rock -- Similar to asteroid except it moves horizontally and the asteroids are random colors.  These are worth 15
points when they are destroyed.

Falcon -- Falcon is anchored at the bottom of the screen and moves side to side.  The movement is not as streamlined as
it should be, but the idea is there is a slide variable that is added to every time the right/left key is pressed until
a maximum value of +/- 10.  In the over-ridden move method that is added to the mid-point to adjust the ship right and
left.  The down key sets the slide value to zero so the ship is stopped. Also falcon's shape is changed.

NewShipFloater -- Changed to move diagonally, with a random x component and a y component of 4.  Otherwise the same.
